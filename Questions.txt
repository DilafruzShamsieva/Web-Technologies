Results: 
Low Tendency towards the Trait (Scores 0-300): If your score falls within this range, it suggests that you have a minimal inclination towards the trait explored in the survey. Your behaviors and preferences may not strongly reflect the characteristics associated with this trait. You tend to exhibit behaviors and make choices that are contrary to the typical attributes of this trait. However, keep in mind that everyone possesses a unique personality, and a low score in this trait does not necessarily indicate a deficiency, but rather a divergence from common patterns.

Moderate Tendency towards the Trait (Scores 301-600): If you scored in this range, it indicates a moderate level of inclination towards the trait. While you may not fully embody it, there are discernible signs of its presence in your behavior and preferences. You exhibit some characteristics associated with this trait, but they may not be consistently evident across all situations. Your responses suggest a nuanced approach to this aspect of your personality, with both trait-aligned and non-trait-aligned behaviors and preferences being observable.

High Tendency towards the Trait (Scores 601-900): A score in this range signifies a strong inclination towards the trait explored in the survey. Your behaviors and preferences likely closely align with the characteristics associated with this trait. You consistently exhibit behaviors and make choices that reflect the attributes commonly associated with this trait. Your responses indicate a clear tendency towards this aspect of your personality, with trait-aligned behaviors and preferences being prominent and easily recognizable in various situations.
